# Python Programming Lab Experiments

This README provides a summary of each experiment conducted in the Python Programming Lab.

## Experiment No. 1: Finding the Biggest Number
**Aim:** To write a Python program to find the biggest number among four numbers using if-else.

**Summary:** The program takes four numbers as input from the user, compares them using if-else statements, and finds the biggest one. 📈

## Experiment No. 2: Prime Number Check
**Aim:** To write a Python program to check if a given number is prime.

**Summary:** The program checks if a number is greater than 1 and uses a loop to check if it is divisible by any other number within a certain range. 🔢

## Experiment No. 3: Palindrome Check
**Aim:** To write a Python program to check if a given number is a palindrome.

**Summary:** The program converts the number to a string, reverses it, and checks if the original and reversed strings are the same. 🔄

## Experiment No. 4: Multiplication Table
**Aim:** To write a Python program to print the multiplication table of a given number.

**Summary:** The program takes a number as input and uses a loop to print its multiplication table from 1 to 10. ✖️

## Experiment No. 5: Mean Calculation
**Aim:** To write a Python program to calculate the mean of a list of numbers.

**Summary:** The program asks the user for the number of values, inputs the values, calculates the sum, and then calculates the mean. 📊

## Experiment No. 6: Existence Check in List
**Aim:** To find if a given number exists in a list and print all its positions.

**Summary:** The program prompts the user to input numbers into a list, then searches for a target number in the list and prints all its positions if found. 🔍

## Experiment No. 7: Sum of Numbers Function
**Aim:** To return the sum of numbers from a list using a function.

**Summary:** The program defines a function to calculate the sum of numbers in a list and prompts the user to input the number of values and the values themselves. ➕

## Experiment No. 8: Employee Details Manipulation
**Aim:** To manipulate employee details using dictionaries and lists.

**Summary:** The program allows the user to input and manipulate employee details such as name, roll number, age, and marks using dictionaries and lists. 👨‍💼

## Experiment No. 9: Student Details Retrieval
**Aim:** To retrieve student details from a list using student number (Sno) as a parameter.

**Summary:** The program prompts the user to input student details, stores them in a list, and then retrieves details based on the student number entered by the user. 📚

## Experiment No. 10: Employee Details Manipulation with Classes
**Aim:** To manipulate employee details using classes and objects.

**Summary:** The program defines a class to represent an employee with methods to input, display, update, and calculate the annual salary of employees. 💼

## Experiment No. 11: Student Details IO Operations
**Aim:** To read and write student details from and to a file using Input/Output (IO) operations.

**Summary:** The program allows the user to write student details to a file and read student details from a file using IO operations. 📝

## Experiment No. 12: CSV Data Analysis
**Aim:** To read content from a CSV file and find the total number of students, maximum marks, and minimum marks.

**Summary:** The program reads student data from a CSV file, analyzes it using pandas, and displays statistics such as total number of students, maximum marks, and minimum marks. 📊
